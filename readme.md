Flat File Creator
=================

This is little is built on the Spring boot platform. It should be easy to build and deploy on just about any server. The
only runtime requirement is JDK 1.8. You will also need Maven 3 if you want to build the deployment package.


Steps to deploy
---------------
1. Run mvn clean install to build the uber JAR
2. Copy the JAR file from the target directory onto the deployment server
3. Start the embedded server by running: java -jar file-tester.jar

This will start the server on port 8080.

Enjoy, please!

I want this to work. Trying again. And one more time!!!
